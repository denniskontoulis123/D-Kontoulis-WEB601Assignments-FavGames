# D Kontoulis WEB601Assignments FavGames
 
Began work at roughly 2pm.  Installed Node roughly a week ago and have left this to the last minute as it seemed pretty straight forward.  My version is newer than 16
but everything seems to run fine upon running the Angular Creation command:
ng new D_Kontoulis_FavouriteGames --style=scss --routing=false

Added scripts to the package + updated it to 0.0.1.  Ran said scripts via:
npm run-script generatecomponent to generate a component
npm run-script generatepipe to generate a pipe
npm run-script generatedirective to generate a directive
Also built out the interface per instructions in the lab, exported and imported to ContentList class.
